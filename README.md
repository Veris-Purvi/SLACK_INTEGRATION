To use the Slack bot, invite it to the desired Slack channel and interact with it using natural language commands. Here are some example commands:

- "Please schedule my meeting with Ms. Anusha in test on 23/03/2023 at 13:30:30 on her email ID anusha.shet@veris.in"

The bot will validate the meeting details and interact with the Veris API to create the meeting invitations. It will notify you of the status and provide any necessary instructions.
